# Microbit-MBot-Zombies

MBots have a great set of tools for interacting with the world
Microbits have excellent communication skills via radio.
Combined we have the potential to create swarms and multi-agent problems.

In a high-school class we're taping microbits to the top of MBots. 
The microbits will control the MBots via their LED panel, the MBot has an ambient light sensor which can sense different light levels from the microbits and act accordingly, effectively giving control to the microbit.
Just like a zombie virus.

This is a multi-agent test platform using the Phaser3.js game engine. 
Choose the number of microbits/MBots in sim.html. 
Write the program for the microbit in main.js. 
Wrappers emulate the microbits and MBots. 
Copy your code to makecode -> Javascript to upload it to real microbits.

Made using node, express, phaser3. 
In terminal run 'npm install' to install the dependencies
Run 'node app.js' to run the simulator.
Open a web browser and go to localhost:8080 to watch the simulator
